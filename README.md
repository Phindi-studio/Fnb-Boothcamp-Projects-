# Fnb-Boothcamp-Projects-
Welcome to my FNB App Academy Bootcamp portfolio. Here you'll find projects like a Superhero App, Pine City Zoo Website, Calculator App, and Contact Book App. Iâ€™m learning front-end and back-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, and APIs to build real-world applications.
